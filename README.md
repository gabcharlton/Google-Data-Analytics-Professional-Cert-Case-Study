# Google-Data-Analytics-Professional-Cert-Case-Study
This is my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certification on Coursera. 

The topic is on analyzing the difference between **annual members** and **casual riders** for **Cyctistic Inc.** to drive future business decisions.

The [Cyclistic Inc. dataset](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) was obtained from Motive International Inc under this [license](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). 

The analysis I did was first carried out via R Studio through the guided project provided by Google. In that nalysis, cleaning, setting up datatypes, and anaylzing 
After that was done, I continued analysis on Jupyter notebooks to better understand user behaviour and to ensure teh data obtained wasn't skewed/ biased.

Please note, the jupyter notebook is a true representation of my work and drive to do that best I cna with data anlysis, while the R file was  true testament to my ability to follow directions and flex my newly founded R skills.
