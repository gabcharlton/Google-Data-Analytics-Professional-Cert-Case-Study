# Introduction

My name is Gabrielle Charlton, and this notebook represents a summary of my analysis of the last 12 months of [Cyclistic trip data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). I have completed the steps of Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, and Share. These steps were  communicated through Google via the Coursera [Google Data Analytics Professional Certification](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics), and this project is my **capstone project**. 


Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
